Case Study: Dimensional Modeling for an E-commerce Platform




Background:



You're a Data Engineer for "Azurelib.com," a fast-growing e-commerce platform. The company has grown exponentially in the last few years, and the management team wants to better understand their sales and customer behavior patterns to make data-driven decisions.



Your task is to design a dimensional model to support the sales analysis of ShopNShip. The key subjects the business is interested in are Sales, Customers, Products, and Time. The high-level requirements are as follows:



Requirements:



Sales Analysis: Track sales revenue, quantity sold, returns, and discounts. The sales data should be analyzed by various dimensions such as time, product, customer, and location.



Customer Analysis: Understand customer behavior in terms of frequency of purchase, returning customers, average purchase amount, and customer segments.



Product Analysis: Identify top-selling products, product categories with high returns, seasonal sales pattern for certain product categories.



Time Analysis: Identify peak sales time (hour, day, month, and year). Find out seasonality in sales and the best performing months/quarters.





Data Available:



Transaction data with details like Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Date and Time of purchase, Quantity, Price, Discount applied, and Return status.



Customer data including Customer ID, Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Signup date, and Location (City, State, Country).



Product data with details such as Product ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-category, Price, and Manufacturer.



Date and Time data for each transaction with granularity up to the hour.





Your task is to create a star schema for the given scenario. Your solution should include:



Identification and definition of facts and dimensions.

Diagram of the star schema.

Brief descriptions of how each table would be used in the analysis.

Remember, the goal is to provide a structure that will allow for intuitive and efficient querying for business intelligence purposes.



Good luck!



PS  You are free to take a few assumptions as well where ever needed.
